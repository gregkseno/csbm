{"text":"i 'll never b going back .","stars":1}
{"text":"then , the server tried to charge me for a new ranch !","stars":1}
{"text":"totally inappropriate for any family restaurant in my opinion .","stars":1}
{"text":"maybe that 's why the inside of the restaurant was so dead .","stars":1}
{"text":"the carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color .","stars":1}
{"text":"was not immediately impressed when i walked in .","stars":1}
{"text":"place is in desperate need of some renovation .","stars":1}
{"text":"drink was served in a cheap plastic cup .","stars":1}

{"text":"gross .","stars":1}
{"text":"i felt bad for the owners of this arizona staple .","stars":1}

{"text":"i do n't like big brother hovering over my shoulder .","stars":1}
{"text":"for that reason , i 'll likely stay away from this establishment .","stars":1}
{"text":"bad customer service .","stars":1}
{"text":"they make me feel uncomfortable to shop for wigs .","stars":1}
{"text":"they are not compassionate or understanding to my condition .","stars":1}
{"text":"i wanted to give you zero stars but it would n't let me .","stars":1}
{"text":"that is ridiculous !","stars":1}
{"text":"the worst experience i have ever had at an enterprise location .","stars":1}
{"text":"very disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"fortunately , there was a ross store down the street .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm pissed because good customer service would have been .","stars":1}
{"text":"we leave and walk the mall .","stars":1}
{"text":"first off , this place is beyond crowded !","stars":1}
{"text":"also , most of the machines are taken all the time .","stars":1}
{"text":"i cancelled my membership after a week .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible gym and service !","stars":1}
{"text":"i went in as a guest no fee charged .","stars":1}
{"text":"he was helpful at first but than treated us as if we were stupid .","stars":1}
{"text":"we started asking questions and he was being very rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is when things started to get ugly .","stars":1}
{"text":"man , was he rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"he stated things like i could n't afford `` quality gyms '' .","stars":1}
{"text":"the equipment is outdated .","stars":1}
{"text":"the restrooms did n't work , toilet paper everywhere .","stars":1}
{"text":"it always feels crowded .","stars":1}

{"text":"this location on the other hand is dirty , unfriendly , and unprofessional .","stars":1}
{"text":"i the steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm pretty sure you 'll walk out of there sick !","stars":1}
{"text":"the worst !","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could rate a zero i would .","stars":1}
{"text":"this gym is always dirty , and equipment is either broken or outdated .","stars":1}
{"text":"avoid this location .","stars":1}
{"text":"equipment was disgusting .","stars":1}
{"text":"i washed my hands and there were no paper towels .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was the same if not worse .","stars":1}
{"text":"the only thing different is that they refilled the paper towel dispenser .","stars":1}
{"text":"that 's pretty ridiculous .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't bother to shower there .","stars":1}
{"text":"never again will i go there .","stars":1}
{"text":"i have to say it 's the worst smelling la fitness in the valley .","stars":1}
{"text":"this gym i way over do for an upgrade .","stars":1}
{"text":"past _num_ days they have opened late .","stars":1}
{"text":"customers do n't have time to lie about a damn membership .","stars":1}
{"text":"but , hair in food ruined the experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"owners speak little to no english .","stars":1}
{"text":"would n't accept my coupon from verizon .","stars":1}
{"text":"overall , would not return .","stars":1}
{"text":"yelp failed us on this one .","stars":1}
{"text":"no problem right stuff happens .","stars":1}

{"text":"will never play here again after playing here today .","stars":1}

{"text":"the round took _num_ 3\/4 hours !","stars":1}
{"text":"the greens are too hard and do n't hold approach shots .","stars":1}
{"text":"bunkers are annoying and inconsistent .","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's just not an enjoyable place to play .","stars":1}
{"text":"better values and better pace elsewhere .","stars":1}
{"text":"mainly a liquor store with gas pumps , some of which are shut down .","stars":1}
{"text":"no pay at pump .","stars":1}
{"text":"we will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location .","stars":1}
{"text":"the entire visit lasted two and a half hours .","stars":1}
{"text":"the receptionist threw me serious shade .","stars":1}
{"text":"so , basically , they left me waiting for that .","stars":1}
{"text":"she just is n't thorough .","stars":1}
{"text":"she just was n't good with people .","stars":1}
{"text":"no one should have to wait _num_ 1\/2 hours to complete a vet exam .","stars":1}
{"text":"it took me _num_ minutes just to drive there one way .","stars":1}
{"text":"she walked out and left me in there for half an hour .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was a lot of staff there , and no customers .","stars":1}
{"text":"no one should wait for what i had to wait for .","stars":1}
{"text":"there are way better places than here so please look else where .","stars":1}
{"text":"they charged for unnecessary supplies for a very poor quality service .","stars":1}
{"text":"two thumbs down .","stars":1}
{"text":"will not come back ... this place has no windows ?","stars":1}
{"text":"decoration is outdated .","stars":1}
{"text":"food , i did n't like .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ordered the teriyaki chicken and it was a little bland .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't eat much of it .","stars":1}
{"text":"overall , it 's a typical chinese american restaurant .","stars":1}
{"text":"poor service .","stars":1}
{"text":"extremely long wait time .","stars":1}
{"text":"avoid this location at all cost !","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ hour wait just for them to bullshit us !","stars":1}

{"text":"i paid the $ _num_ and have never been back .","stars":1}
{"text":"these people are complete idiots .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would avoid this place as their diagnostic skills are pathetic .","stars":1}
{"text":"called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was a little rude and off putting .","stars":1}
{"text":"i hardly doubt they reached their limit on a tuesday but who knows .","stars":1}
{"text":"very sad .","stars":1}
{"text":"gross .","stars":1}
{"text":"nothing at all .","stars":1}
{"text":"the whole drink area was a mess as was the dining area .","stars":1}
{"text":"just a terrible location .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was n't any better .","stars":1}
{"text":"the guy in front of us was ordering in spanish .","stars":1}
{"text":"asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken .","stars":1}
{"text":"then she asks me what entree .","stars":1}
{"text":"ugh .","stars":1}
{"text":"my boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything .","stars":1}
{"text":"then i get up to the register .","stars":1}
{"text":"she rings me up and hands me one cup .","stars":1}
{"text":"sat down to eat .","stars":1}
{"text":"the honey sesame chicken was cold .","stars":1}
{"text":"the orange chicken was barely warm .","stars":1}
{"text":"this last trip may have been the breaking point .","stars":1}
{"text":"even when they about and should be trying to get rid of their food .","stars":1}
{"text":"poor service .","stars":1}
{"text":"when you pay for your order her proceeds to walk away after your change .","stars":1}
{"text":"does n't offer and soy sauce or anything else .","stars":1}
{"text":"very unimpressed and wo n't be coming back again .","stars":1}
{"text":"tip to all the panda express managers .","stars":1}
{"text":"will not be coming back to this location .","stars":1}
{"text":"the manager was yelling at the cashier while we placed our order .","stars":1}
{"text":"a little over an hour wasted sitting waiting ... absolutely horrible customer service .","stars":1}
{"text":"this has to be the worst pizza hut location i have been to .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was told the wait time would be _num_ minutes .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ended up waiting almost _num_ mins which was inconvenient .","stars":1}
{"text":"its not hard to take an order .","stars":1}
{"text":"the place in general was not clean .","stars":1}
{"text":"poor customer service , poor quality pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"the worst customer service ever !","stars":1}
{"text":"they 've gotten my order wrong every time !","stars":1}
{"text":"customer service _num_ : never argue with a customer !","stars":1}
{"text":"how rude !","stars":1}
{"text":"i have already called like _num_ times .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not order from here they are the worst !","stars":1}
{"text":"i keep trying to give this place a chance .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not spend your hard earned money at this location .","stars":1}
{"text":"the upside down blizzard was water down .","stars":1}
{"text":"i gave them a call and never answered .","stars":1}
{"text":"left them a voicemail and never returned my call .","stars":1}
{"text":"disappointed !","stars":1}
{"text":"first , the cashier clearly did n't want to be there .","stars":1}
{"text":"she did n't greet me politely or acknowledge that i was there .","stars":1}
{"text":"she did n't apologize for the error .","stars":1}
{"text":"if anything , she seemed annoyed that she had to correct the order .","stars":1}
{"text":"next , the total was $ _num_ ( i also ordered a blizzard ) .","stars":1}
{"text":"she was too confused to answer my question .","stars":1}
{"text":"some basic math and people skills would make the customer experience a lot better !","stars":1}
{"text":"i would give this _num_ stars if possible .","stars":1}
{"text":"my husband and i went to dq and we went through the drive through .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was hardly any ice cream at all in mine .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would n't recommend this stupid place at all !","stars":1}
{"text":"bad service .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do n't recommend going there .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is awful .","stars":1}
{"text":"terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"promised glasses would be ready for pickup within _num_ to _num_ business days .","stars":1}
{"text":"stay away from this unprofessional establishment .","stars":1}
{"text":"disgusting !","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say , we all stopped eating and felt sick to our stomachs .","stars":1}
{"text":"ca n't get basic orders correct .","stars":1}
{"text":"asked for sausage egg cheese biscuit with bacon instead of sausage .","stars":1}
{"text":"two other customers had incorrect orders at the same time too .","stars":1}
{"text":"absolutely ridiculous , i would not recommend this location at all !","stars":1}
{"text":"this is the third time in a row , we will not be returning !","stars":1}
{"text":"finally they said it 'll be ready in _num_ mins .","stars":1}
{"text":"my husband has had problems with this location too .","stars":1}
{"text":"i had it transferred to another location and got my meds in _num_ mins .","stars":1}
{"text":"i love kfc , but this location is horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"the chicken was dry and way overcooked .","stars":1}
{"text":"they really need to get some workers in there that know how to cook .","stars":1}
{"text":"i gave _num_ star for the side dishes .","stars":1}
{"text":"wo n't be back .","stars":1}
{"text":"fuck this place and their lack of white chicken and corn .","stars":1}
{"text":"the least they could do was substitute tenders in place of breast .","stars":1}
{"text":"only reason i gave them _num_ star is because i had to .","stars":1}
{"text":"they lost a sale and customer for being cheap .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not go here for food .","stars":1}
{"text":"it might actually be worse than little caesar 's or peter piper .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't even hang out in the parking lot .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't eat the pizza , or hang out .","stars":1}
{"text":"really , that 's not too much to change , right ?","stars":1}
{"text":"any chain restaurant , for that matter , has better pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"save your money and get a $ _num_ hot n ' ready !","stars":1}
{"text":"i ordered a large pepperoni for $ _num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"my wife and i thought the sauce tasted more like ketchup than pizza sauce .","stars":1}
{"text":"sometimes i have to repeat no , this store in particular .","stars":1}
{"text":"no apology or nothing !","stars":1}
{"text":"i ran out of this place and i will never ever come back !","stars":1}
{"text":"very messy and unorganized ... not too many clothes or shoes to choose from .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible service .","stars":1}
{"text":"arrived early to my appointment scheduled at 3pm .","stars":1}
{"text":"spent _num_ minutes passed that to finally be attended too .","stars":1}
{"text":"after slow service this morning i decided to look up this business on yelp .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could give lower , i would .","stars":1}
{"text":"i waited for _num_ minutes to open to replace my battery .","stars":1}
{"text":"it too was similar .","stars":1}
{"text":"that 's too bad cause this is the closest sears to my house .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is just not a good way to run a business .","stars":1}
{"text":"how else can one explain the _num_ and _num_ stars for this place ?","stars":1}
{"text":"the hot n sour soup was okay .","stars":1}
{"text":"my partner thought it too sour .","stars":1}
{"text":"the `` sour '' is n't in the name to make it sound pretty .","stars":1}
{"text":"it looks like someone 's already eaten it ! ''","stars":1}
{"text":"but what was n't acceptable was the salt level in the food .","stars":1}
{"text":"oh god in heaven : no !","stars":1}
{"text":"it had very little sauce and very little cheese .","stars":1}
{"text":"completely flavorless in my opinion .","stars":1}
{"text":"the crust was plain and there was a lot of it .","stars":1}
{"text":"i wo n't be ordering pizza from here again .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 've had much better elsewhere .","stars":1}
{"text":"this was awful pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"ordered a large supreme and it had next to no meat veggies on it .","stars":1}
{"text":"they were out of mushrooms , so i expected more veggies on it .","stars":1}
{"text":"the crust on a frozen pizza was better than the crust on this one .","stars":1}
{"text":"but , all _num_ wings were bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"the past _num_ years they have really gone down hill .","stars":1}
{"text":"the dough for the pizza has lost it taste and texture .","stars":1}
{"text":"anyhow , i think there are probably better places to eat in the area .","stars":1}
{"text":"the bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not get tamales with baja sauce ... it 's mush .","stars":1}
{"text":"mango margarita was pretty bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"i spoke with a manager , erica martin about our happy hour drinks .","stars":1}
{"text":"she was beyond rude , even started talking down about us to the staff .","stars":1}
{"text":"she would drag on the words in a high pitch voice .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food is lacking quality and cost is not that great .","stars":1}
{"text":"this restaurant does not know how to make them .","stars":1}
{"text":"they were quite disgusting .","stars":1}
{"text":"extremely dense and hard to eat .","stars":1}
{"text":"not very tasty , not authentic sopapillas .","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal .","stars":1}
{"text":"i assure you , i have no problem paying my way .","stars":1}
{"text":"this woman has no business being in the hospitality industry .","stars":1}
{"text":"not her , and this location is going to pay for her mistake .","stars":1}
{"text":"i noticed a reply on my rating .","stars":1}
{"text":"slow service , mediocre mexican food .","stars":1}
{"text":"i will never set foot inside another macayo 's again .","stars":1}
{"text":"goodbye macayo 's , you will be missed .","stars":1}
{"text":"another _num_ minutes goes by and we have no water and no service .","stars":1}
{"text":"took _num_ minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong .","stars":1}
{"text":"still no server at this point .","stars":1}
{"text":"sure enough , another _num_ minutes go by .","stars":1}
{"text":"we are late for our concert at this point and beyond frustrated .","stars":1}
{"text":"finally the food comes , and of course , the order is wrong .","stars":1}
{"text":"i have never had such terrible service , especially from management as well .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food was disgusting .","stars":1}
{"text":"wo n't be back .","stars":1}
{"text":"no problem with the actual care at the facility .","stars":1}
{"text":"( this was done a week previous to this . )","stars":1}
{"text":"they are consistently rude and unprofessional .","stars":1}
{"text":"ultimately , it felt like being in a factory .","stars":1}
{"text":"all the _num_ star reviews are very odd to me .","stars":1}
{"text":"service was fast but poor .","stars":1}
{"text":"more importantly , the food sucked .","stars":1}
{"text":"the fried rice was terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"not really fried rice , just seasoned rice .","stars":1}
{"text":"i got like a pound and it had about three bites of egg .","stars":1}
{"text":"the beef was overcooked and chewy .","stars":1}
{"text":"they get _num_ stars for the huge portions .","stars":1}
{"text":"food was `` meh '' , maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .","stars":1}
{"text":"i am not a fan .","stars":1}
{"text":"the orange chicken was not good .","stars":1}
{"text":"the chicken egg foo young was ok .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food was n't bad , but it did lack flavor .","stars":1}
{"text":"i have to say , i find the meat to be super sketchy .","stars":1}
{"text":"service - sketchy ... um appetizers are served before the entree not after .","stars":1}
{"text":"not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish .","stars":1}
{"text":"meaning mexican style fajita cooking .","stars":1}
{"text":"or did you just quit caring ?","stars":1}
{"text":"shame on you !","stars":1}
{"text":"that is just bizarre ... at best .","stars":1}
{"text":"in a city with a million bars do n't waste your cash here .","stars":1}
{"text":"i saw them put _num_ small containers front of me and said no .","stars":1}
{"text":"they are cheap .","stars":1}
{"text":"hate the service .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place was freezing cold inside !","stars":1}
{"text":"the sweet and sour pork , taste like chicken nuggets !","stars":1}
{"text":"the egg roll , over cooked , greasy , stale and horrible !","stars":1}
{"text":"wait lets not talk about it !","stars":1}
{"text":"by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had in my entire life .","stars":1}
{"text":"whatever you can imagine being bad ... it is .","stars":1}
{"text":"however , i 'm not paying for any of those things .","stars":1}
{"text":"so i been looking for a year .","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ for mani gel they did n't charge me for removal .","stars":1}
{"text":"she did n't file my nails nor even clean them out .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place did not and i was unable to finish my $ _num_ cocktail .","stars":1}
{"text":"Negative","stars":1}
{"text":"i would give this place a negative score if possible .","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say , i have n't been back since .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was hot but i noticed immediately , no pizza aroma !","stars":1}
{"text":"i guess if you do n't mind doing that it 's worth $ _num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"the star is for me and my seasoning additions !","stars":1}
{"text":"haha could give another star for convenience but parking is bad !","stars":1}
{"text":"their salsas are not spicy or flavorful .","stars":1}
{"text":"they do n't add much to the meal .","stars":1}
{"text":"there are only like _num_ chairs inside .","stars":1}
{"text":"customer service is n't good .","stars":1}
{"text":"my standards are n't met .","stars":1}
{"text":"the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !","stars":1}
{"text":"this doctor was horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would give zero stars if possible .","stars":1}
{"text":"my second visit just got worse .","stars":1}
{"text":"she had no compassion during a time of loss .","stars":1}
{"text":"she then did not follow the comment up with a reason !","stars":1}
{"text":"are you freaking kidding me ?","stars":1}
{"text":"but i should have gone to a real salon .","stars":1}
{"text":"she handed me the mirror and said `` what do you think ? ''","stars":1}
{"text":"i ca n't do that .","stars":1}
{"text":"but i can try to texture it . ''","stars":1}
{"text":"she became defensive .","stars":1}
{"text":"maybe she was confused to what i meant ?","stars":1}
{"text":"sorry but extremely pissed at them and will never be back !","stars":1}
{"text":"only wish i could have given them _num_ stars .","stars":1}
{"text":"i totally regret ordering from them .","stars":1}
{"text":"the pizza came more quickly than we had anticipated !","stars":1}
{"text":"not going to bother having another sent out because we 're so hungry .","stars":1}
{"text":"my dough was mushy , crust was soft and had no crisp to it .","stars":1}
{"text":"very very disappointing .","stars":1}
{"text":"but didnt think it meant getting a _num_ % cooked pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"wish i could get my tip back .","stars":1}
{"text":"?","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is horrible , ca n't even finish my lunch .","stars":1}
{"text":"this kung pao chicken is garbage .","stars":1}
{"text":"the meat is dark , fatty , and does n't even taste like chicken .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was sadly disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"probably the least appetizing chinese food i 've had in my life .","stars":1}
{"text":"ingredients were of low quality with no taste .","stars":1}
{"text":"however i am not satisfied with this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"so disappointed , most likely wo n't be returning .","stars":1}
{"text":"not to mention , they messed up on my dad 's order .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is a oil change express station with two servicing stations .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is the worst place i have ever been too .","stars":1}
{"text":"i leave not even a block away everything comes back on once again .","stars":1}
{"text":"not recommended just go to walmart or somewhere else .","stars":1}
{"text":"can never get things fixed .","stars":1}
{"text":"george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .","stars":1}
{"text":"the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is worse than a prison !","stars":1}
{"text":"i called to help one of my employees get an apartment today .","stars":1}
{"text":"he was extremely rude , and he hung up on me !","stars":1}
{"text":"can never get things fixed .","stars":1}
{"text":"george is probably the only trustworthy employee in this whole entire complex .","stars":1}
{"text":"the rest are worthless , unreliable , and extremely rude and unprofessional !","stars":1}
{"text":"do not move here !","stars":1}
{"text":"the most awful place to move to !","stars":1}
{"text":"the only good thing about this place is that its cheap .","stars":1}
{"text":"that 's not my problem !","stars":1}
{"text":"we opened the door to the room , it smelled .","stars":1}
{"text":"i asked for _num_ queen beds and got _num_ double beds .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't really care where i was going to stay .","stars":1}
{"text":"so , this place was perfect to just sleep and go .","stars":1}
{"text":"the elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor .","stars":1}
{"text":"the room is simple with a small electric stove , sink , and microwave .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't have tub , just a shower with a seat .","stars":1}
{"text":"for some reason , my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place .","stars":1}
{"text":"someone did n't clean the place thoroughly .","stars":1}
{"text":"yelp is my review , my story , and my life .","stars":1}
{"text":"disgusting rooms ... noisy ... smelly ... loaded with homeless people ... horrible experience .","stars":1}

{"text":"so they obliged and gave me another room ( pro ? )","stars":1}
{"text":"it was rated two star on hotwire but that was a real stretch !","stars":1}
{"text":"this place does n't deserve one start nevertheless the _num_ star rating on hotwire .","stars":1}
{"text":"the next room was not under construction but clearly needed repairs .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place deserves a big fat zero rating .","stars":1}
{"text":"they deserve a star .","stars":1}
{"text":"that was bad sign # _num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"bad sign # _num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"the door would not open .","stars":1}

{"text":"unfortunately we had o option then to stay there .","stars":1}
{"text":"honestly the worst service ever !","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could rate it _num_ stars , i would .","stars":1}
{"text":"it just looked like the bed had been made and that 's it .","stars":1}
{"text":"the second room was better , but still nothing spectacular .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm glad i got this for such a cheap price through hotwire .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would not have payed more otherwise .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was n't worth it .","stars":1}
{"text":"first impression : the place is really really dirty .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't want to drink out of my glass .","stars":1}
{"text":"nothing to write home about , but i 'll write it on yelp .","stars":1}
{"text":"the service was friendly and the food was n't very expensive .","stars":1}
{"text":"but it was n't all that good either .","stars":1}
{"text":"total rip-off !","stars":1}
{"text":"the only answer i got was prices are different after certain hours .","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say i will not be returning !","stars":1}
{"text":"not the best mexican resturant we 've been to , but it 's cheap !","stars":1}
{"text":"went through drive thru , ordered two _num_ piece chicken strips .","stars":1}
{"text":"drove away , got on freeway headed out of town .","stars":1}
{"text":"i had to get off freeway and return them .","stars":1}
{"text":"as soon as she saw me she knew why i was there .","stars":1}
{"text":"she did agree to adding a order of fries free of charge .","stars":1}
{"text":"not cool .","stars":1}
{"text":"the young girl working is rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"poor poor customer service .","stars":1}
{"text":"no one is behind me not no line .","stars":1}
{"text":"so rude !","stars":1}
{"text":"is this a race or she just hates taking orders ?","stars":1}
{"text":"no patience at all !","stars":1}
{"text":"worst ever .","stars":1}
{"text":"terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"i will not be returning to this location .","stars":1}
{"text":"where i come from they skate , not here .","stars":1}
{"text":"this would have been the second time the tried to double charge me .","stars":1}
{"text":"i showed approved and then showed printing receipt .","stars":1}
{"text":"so he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money .","stars":1}
{"text":"half the time they ca n't get my order right .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place does n't even deserve the one star i 'm giving them .","stars":1}
{"text":"we waited for _num_ minutes and ended up leaving with no food .","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ minutes after ordering : grills broken , no hotdogs .","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ for the homeless .","stars":1}
{"text":"we walked in and the place was dirty and not well lit .","stars":1}
{"text":"we walk up and wait a bit in line , no big deal .","stars":1}
{"text":"so he offered to replace the _num_ piece white with _num_ dark meat choices .","stars":1}
{"text":"which is less than we paid for by the way .","stars":1}
{"text":"the guy said sorry for the wait but he did n't mean it .","stars":1}
{"text":"he sure as hell didnt .","stars":1}
{"text":"we get back home and the order was wrong .","stars":1}
{"text":"all the sides were wrong .","stars":1}
{"text":"skip skip skip it .","stars":1}
{"text":"while the food itself seems to taste okay .","stars":1}
{"text":"it has not been the same on several occasions .","stars":1}
{"text":"she tries to upsell me on the meal , i say no .","stars":1}
{"text":"girl is yelling in the background `` that 's what she ordered ! ''","stars":1}
{"text":"he gave me my money back .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was disgusting .","stars":1}
{"text":"you can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa , jerks .","stars":1}
{"text":"is their clientele so vast that they can afford to treat people like crap ?","stars":1}
{"text":"so done trying new nail places .","stars":1}
{"text":"oops , i was using caps !","stars":1}
{"text":"they lost touch and do n't know how to deal with the living !","stars":1}
{"text":"terrible experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"big mistake .","stars":1}
{"text":"this made us a little uncomfortable .","stars":1}
{"text":"this does not make any sense .","stars":1}
{"text":"finally , we were pressured to donate our relatives body to medical research .","stars":1}
{"text":"they said the van was there but could n't find us .","stars":1}
{"text":"it added unfortunate stress to an already stressful day .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is not something the family should have to deal with !","stars":1}
{"text":"my uncle died very suddenly and unexpectedly .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is the worst funeral home ever !","stars":1}
{"text":"the customer service is horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"denise did n't remember ever speaking with me .","stars":1}
{"text":"so frustrating .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible customer service !","stars":1}
{"text":"they were unprofessional , rude and extremely difficult to deal with .","stars":1}
{"text":"instead , they made everything so much hard and more painful .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could give _num_ stars i would .","stars":1}
{"text":"the customer service is horrible !","stars":1}
{"text":"avoid coming to this ghetto target !","stars":1}

{"text":"which made me just lose my appetite all together !","stars":1}
{"text":"our server was really really rude .","stars":1}

{"text":"the server nikki was awful , the food was mediocre at best .","stars":1}
{"text":"had a terrible meal here from start to finish .","stars":1}
{"text":"these must have been frozen at some point , they were watery and tasteless .","stars":1}
{"text":"even my brother did n't want to finish them .","stars":1}
{"text":"the dressing was thin and tasteless , very little blue cheese flavor .","stars":1}
{"text":"my husband and i were dining here for valentines day last year .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was the most rudest most disrespectful thing he could have done .","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ % tip from your bill is more then enough if you ask me .","stars":1}
{"text":"normally a person will tip _num_ % - _num_ % of their bill .","stars":1}
{"text":"very sub par place .","stars":1}
{"text":"everything was so very salty .","stars":1}
{"text":"no wonder the place was empty .","stars":1}
{"text":"service was alright but the food was terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"not only is the service terrible , the management is terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"i just had the worst experience ever .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was that bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"good food but poor cleanliness apparently .","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say we left and will not be back .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us .","stars":1}
{"text":"my husband and i came here because we were missing the seafood back home .","stars":1}
{"text":"i could n't even eat part of my meal .","stars":1}
{"text":"she brought me my drink , minus the straw .","stars":1}
{"text":"said she 'd be back with it , never returned with one .","stars":1}
{"text":"Neutral","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could give this a negative star , i would .","stars":1}
{"text":"i can deal with poor customer service , but finding glass in a biscuit ?","stars":1}
{"text":"unacceptable !","stars":1}
{"text":"luckily he was wearing leather pants , so he just dried himself off .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not eat here .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible service .","stars":1}
{"text":"its not worth what they charge .","stars":1}
{"text":"shame on you texas roadhouse .","stars":1}
{"text":"wo n't be back for quite awhile .","stars":1}
{"text":"cold potato , the cheese would n't even melt .","stars":1}
{"text":"husband ordered the ribeye and it too was cooked well done .","stars":1}
{"text":"when is the last time you were here '' blah blah blah .","stars":1}
{"text":"by the time our food got to the table , our drinks were empty .","stars":1}
{"text":"the waitress then offered to refill our bread basket .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was disappointed with the steak fries as they were mushy .","stars":1}
{"text":"of my entree , only the salad was great !","stars":1}
{"text":"my son 's smothered steak was da bomb !","stars":1}
{"text":"i wish i 'd gone to the big apple instead .","stars":1}
{"text":"not sure ?","stars":1}
{"text":"but quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing .","stars":1}
{"text":"the noise level was quite ridiculous .","stars":1}
{"text":"it is tolerable maybe once but not four times .","stars":1}
{"text":"after _num_ of these i was going a little insane .","stars":1}
{"text":"my salad was meh and my fianc 's ribs were a little dry .","stars":1}
{"text":"i had never been to a texas roadhouse quite like this one .","stars":1}
{"text":"as im using the restroom one of the workers com in to clean .","stars":1}
{"text":"that 's not that worst part .","stars":1}
{"text":"im pissed !","stars":1}
{"text":"that tells me you are not paying attention to what you are doing .","stars":1}
{"text":"i also notice that floor was really and there was no wet floor sign .","stars":1}
{"text":"i walk away and go to the host and ask for a manager .","stars":1}
{"text":"the manager said well i talk to her .","stars":1}
{"text":"the fried outer layer was overcooked , over salted and smooth .","stars":1}
{"text":"it fell short of the layered , fried chicken crust this dish should have .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do n't even think we 'll bother going back there .","stars":1}
{"text":"the beer is still cold and good .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was pretty awful .","stars":1}
{"text":"we were so disappointed the chicken fried sirloin is so terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"it is the stuff of nightmares .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible system with seating .","stars":1}
{"text":"the menu has nothing healthy on it .","stars":1}
{"text":"so , i did n't order much .","stars":1}
{"text":"my one take spoon of blue cheese dressing to go with it was ok .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was a thick burger smothered with salty onions , mushrooms & cheese .","stars":1}
{"text":"all in all ... we will not be coming back .","stars":1}
{"text":"go back and have bad service again and spend more $ ?","stars":1}
{"text":"it was disgusting !","stars":1}
{"text":"i am not sure what the big deal is about this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"we should have gotten up and walked out to go someplace else .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't like his service at all .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"i spent $ _num_ and they want me to pay for dips .","stars":1}

{"text":"i 'm not going back there next time .","stars":1}
{"text":"the wings was n't that good .","stars":1}
{"text":"i will not recommend anyone to this location or any of their franchise period .","stars":1}

{"text":"worst customer service ever !","stars":1}
{"text":"she says no i 'm a lead or something of that sort .","stars":1}

{"text":"this place is consistently bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"first impression when i walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets .","stars":1}
{"text":"gross !","stars":1}
{"text":"the food in my opinion is so commercial .","stars":1}
{"text":"i really do n't get why people come here so often .","stars":1}
{"text":"i guess everyone is so used to their mcdonalds and microwave dinners .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce .","stars":1}

{"text":"not to mention that is not even busy !","stars":1}
{"text":"i had to choose _num_ star otherwise , i could n't post this review !","stars":1}
{"text":"this location deserves zero stars !","stars":1}

{"text":"people have bad days .","stars":1}
{"text":"businesses have bad days .","stars":1}
{"text":"a month apart and now i am concerned about having another experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"who does n't want to savor every minute of their lunch hour ?","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm not talking about running a few minutes late either .","stars":1}
{"text":"i show up a few minutes late and still wait an additional 10-15 minutes .","stars":1}
{"text":"as i said before , one pass .","stars":1}
{"text":"we still had to wait longer than our scheduled pick up time .","stars":1}
{"text":"then someone suggested leaving a yelp review , so here i am .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do n't want to spend 10-15 additional minutes of my lunch hour waiting .","stars":1}

{"text":"water glasses , dirty .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm just disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"that seems incredibly unacceptable .","stars":1}
{"text":"the waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us .","stars":1}
{"text":"when seated the table was not clean .","stars":1}
{"text":"overall would never visit that location again and would n't advise you to either .","stars":1}

{"text":"the worse service ever !","stars":1}
{"text":"do not go here and waste your money !","stars":1}
{"text":"very disappointed never going back to this ghetto restaurant is horrible !","stars":1}

{"text":"it 's not hard to find , i swear .","stars":1}
{"text":"without complaining , i had received a coupon for a free large pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"i built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment .","stars":1}
{"text":"i sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was extremely disappointed with our experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"the third order our garlic knots were burnt and hard .","stars":1}

{"text":"the course is in even worse condition from when the pictures were taken .","stars":1}
{"text":"no green grass at all .","stars":1}
{"text":"the greens were barely being watered .","stars":1}
{"text":"what a shame !","stars":1}
{"text":"i would be embarrassed to call this my golf course .","stars":1}
{"text":"just terrible !","stars":1}
{"text":"there were many customer dogs in the store , and nobody was petting them !","stars":1}
{"text":"in general , this petsmart just was not a fun place to be .","stars":1}
{"text":"this location does n't even come close to being awesome .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ca n't believe that i just paid $ _num_ for her groom .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible service .","stars":1}
{"text":"went to get my dogs nails trimmed and bath .","stars":1}
{"text":"i only go since it is on the way home from work .","stars":1}
{"text":"the selection is just so-so .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was there yesterday , and the line was nine customers deep .","stars":1}
{"text":"he did not even bother requesting a price check .","stars":1}
{"text":"any other store , one could request a price check .","stars":1}
{"text":"terrible customer service couldnt even tell me how much was on a gift card .","stars":1}
{"text":"let alone the store manager was snotty and rude !","stars":1}
{"text":"will not be back ever and filed a complaint !","stars":1}
{"text":"refuse to be treated poorly .","stars":1}
{"text":"this particular petsmart is no exception .","stars":1}
{"text":"we drove _num_ minutes across town to adopt a kitten .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't waste your money here .","stars":1}
{"text":"i got sucked in .","stars":1}
{"text":"well that 's a load of horse $ h !","stars":1}
{"text":"the cheese bread was yummy as well !","stars":1}
{"text":"do not get sucked into the hype of that dumb commercial .","stars":1}
{"text":"hey we have been getting complaints that our pizza sucks .","stars":1}
{"text":"so we changed it up and guess what pizza still sucks !","stars":1}
{"text":"tasted like they put tons of salt on it .","stars":1}
{"text":"the cheesy bread was cheesy , crappy , and salty all rolled into one .","stars":1}
{"text":"gross gross gross !","stars":1}
{"text":"Positive","stars":1}
{"text":"i would give this place negative stars if i could .","stars":1}
{"text":"frankly , i know better than to order wings from a national chain store .","stars":1}
{"text":"but domino 's is at least on par with pizza hut and papa johns .","stars":1}
{"text":"is n't this dinner time ?","stars":1}
{"text":"do not go here .","stars":1}
{"text":"i asked if she could void the transaction and again i got a no .","stars":1}
{"text":"she just told me to pick something else .","stars":1}
{"text":"so i did but still not satisfied .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would never take my jewelry here again .","stars":1}
{"text":"the owner was very rude !","stars":1}
{"text":"i then asked how long it would take was quoted _num_ hours .","stars":1}
{"text":"very rudely he asked if he should do my fix before everyone else 's .","stars":1}
{"text":"i asked why he was being so rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's not wise to assume everyone knows the way your business is run .","stars":1}
{"text":"rude !","stars":1}
{"text":"however i will never do business there again .","stars":1}
{"text":"rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not trust these people , and also rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"as of harkins goes this theater is a hit or miss .","stars":1}
{"text":"the seating sucks .","stars":1}
{"text":"the movie detail sucks .","stars":1}
{"text":"the popcorn sucks .","stars":1}
{"text":"the management sucks .","stars":1}
{"text":"so they leave you with a terrible experience every , single , time .","stars":1}
{"text":"like i said , i did my homework .","stars":1}
{"text":"i also noticed these prices were pretty stiff .","stars":1}
{"text":"in sum , a very bad experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"the place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control .","stars":1}
{"text":"its ok , i guess .","stars":1}
{"text":"but it reminds me off chinese food prepared for a mexican clientele .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food was disgusting and gross .","stars":1}
{"text":"food was so bad we left without eating .","stars":1}
{"text":"if you like these fake chinese buffets , then ignore this review .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was awful .","stars":1}
{"text":"i agree with jason b , the service here sucks !","stars":1}
{"text":"this was not a pleasant experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"very disappointing food and waste of my time .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could give this place no stars , i would .","stars":1}
{"text":"luckily i had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was an employee drinking beer while he was working .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place was a disaster .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible !","stars":1}
{"text":"serves bad and slow .","stars":1}
{"text":"food cold , tasteless and soggy .","stars":1}
{"text":"saw the show and came to see _num_ stars , forget it .","stars":1}
{"text":"no silverware .","stars":1}
{"text":"we waited _num_ minutes we were not even offered any water or anything .","stars":1}
{"text":"not a good experience maybe a bad night for them ?","stars":1}
{"text":"nightmares of hungry people and no food ... .","stars":1}
{"text":"the decor was a lot nicer than i was expecting too .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady .","stars":1}
{"text":"poor ambience and operations .","stars":1}
{"text":"food is ok but service is something that is lacking .","stars":1}
{"text":"she is also an canadian \/ bosnian .","stars":1}
{"text":"it a hole in the wall in the middle of crack haven .","stars":1}
{"text":"the cheese pita might be the same _num_ , close to it .","stars":1}
{"text":"really not impressed at all .","stars":1}
{"text":"mediocre quality , at best .","stars":1}
{"text":"too much bread ( $ ) for not enough meat ( meat ) .","stars":1}
{"text":"the wheat bread was not very good , and too thick .","stars":1}
{"text":"overall , i was not impressed and regret going .","stars":1}
{"text":"the sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing .","stars":1}
{"text":"but on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was corned beef on a roll .","stars":1}
{"text":"i asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better .","stars":1}
{"text":"the people working seemed very confused making my sandwich .","stars":1}
{"text":"they toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave .","stars":1}
{"text":"i tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed .","stars":1}
{"text":"my husband purchased some of their house made hot sausage .","stars":1}
{"text":"any two different items _num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"the very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem .","stars":1}
{"text":"this was our cue to leave .","stars":1}
{"text":"this makes my sandwhich wrapping a mess !","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say we were shocked .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was told because the neighborhood is bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"the neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers .","stars":1}
{"text":"not worth it to me .","stars":1}
{"text":"the attitude just gets worse as you 're shopping and checking out .","stars":1}
{"text":"as a female i am personally offended by this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"stop by for a beer sat .","stars":1}
{"text":"they are charging _num_ a bottle .","stars":1}
{"text":"i wo n't be stopping there again .","stars":1}
{"text":"some of my favorite bars have been considered dive bars .","stars":1}
{"text":"should n't have wasted our time .","stars":1}
{"text":"walked in and no hello from the bartender .","stars":1}
{"text":"no , we are locals .","stars":1}
{"text":"she welcomed us and said hello as soon as we walked in .","stars":1}
{"text":"stopped by for a local , fire grilled burger .","stars":1}
{"text":"what a disappointment .","stars":1}
{"text":"it sure was quick , but , come on !","stars":1}
{"text":"this was not good .","stars":1}
{"text":"maybe it was a bad day , but .","stars":1}
{"text":"first off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio .","stars":1}
{"text":"all i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun .","stars":1}
{"text":"at least this _num_ minute wait wont end badly .","stars":1}
{"text":"i paid _num_ for a no _num_ combo with a beyond small shake .","stars":1}
{"text":"i have went to this location over a hundred times in high school .","stars":1}
{"text":"however , now as an adult the experience was not the same .","stars":1}
{"text":"( which the soda was flat ) .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was blatantly ignored and when i asked again .","stars":1}
{"text":"i literally could n't believe what had happened .","stars":1}
{"text":"i am never going to this one again .","stars":1}
{"text":"that is n't cool .","stars":1}
{"text":"not satisfied at all .","stars":1}
{"text":"i want my old lenny 's back .","stars":1}
{"text":"i still want my old hole in the wall lenny 's back .","stars":1}
{"text":"location is not really nice .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was there just as long as if i had ordered in the store .","stars":1}
{"text":"bad business decision , in my opinion .","stars":1}
{"text":"their comics are also in poor condition .","stars":1}
{"text":"they do n't take care of their comics .","stars":1}
{"text":"first off , their lay out is all over the place .","stars":1}
{"text":"that is to say , service was totally non-existent .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 've gone with my mother to buy appliances here .","stars":1}
{"text":"i spent almost _num_ min laughing at just _num_ jacket .","stars":1}
{"text":"there are no mirrors !","stars":1}
{"text":"i could n't find a mirror to save my life !","stars":1}
{"text":"the restrooms were a disaster !","stars":1}
{"text":"just gross .","stars":1}
{"text":"there are _num_ sinks but only _num_ mirror in there too .","stars":1}
{"text":"anyway , i saw _num_ shirt that was semi cute .","stars":1}
{"text":"pretty sad , really .","stars":1}
{"text":"not so much .","stars":1}
{"text":"it took them two days to come out and fix my fridge .","stars":1}
{"text":"then they did not have the part and rescheduled for the next week !","stars":1}
{"text":"it was easy to shop because there is not many people in the aisles .","stars":1}
{"text":"i left my purchases there along with another customer .","stars":1}
{"text":"then he had to leave and try and get my refund processed .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ca n't help but understand why sears is in such financial trouble .","stars":1}
{"text":"no problem , i 'll take my business somewhere else .","stars":1}
{"text":"ca n't even supply their shoppers with shopping carts .","stars":1}
{"text":"save your money and do n't buy a warranty !","stars":1}
{"text":"i was told that i would have to wait over a week for repair .","stars":1}
{"text":"the repair was made and the fridge stopped working the same night .","stars":1}
{"text":"i never got a call and a repair was never made .","stars":1}
{"text":"this means for over a month i will have no refrigerator .","stars":1}
{"text":"the staff is extremely rude and unorganized !","stars":1}
{"text":"i have never been so disappointed !","stars":1}
{"text":"the restroom had no toilet paper or hand soap .","stars":1}
{"text":"to top it off the food was prepared with no gloves .","stars":1}
{"text":"the store is very busy from 8am to about 10pm at night .","stars":1}
{"text":"pumps and bathrooms are always dirty .","stars":1}
{"text":"this one is trashy !","stars":1}
{"text":"bathrooms were disgusting .","stars":1}
{"text":"had i reviewed it i would have given it a solid _num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"now i want to give it a zero .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do n't know what happened but the mongolian bbq no longer exists .","stars":1}
{"text":"so sad .","stars":1}
{"text":"called in a delivery order from this location and it was late .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ordered pizza hut the next time i wanted pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"papa johns pizza is nasty .","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's the worst pizza i 've ever had .","stars":1}
{"text":"absolute worst banking experience i have ever had .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place seriously needs more tellers .","stars":1}
{"text":"the waiting time is just ridiculous .","stars":1}
{"text":"one time i came in on a friday and only one teller was working .","stars":1}
{"text":"i really hate coming here .","stars":1}
{"text":"got ripped off big time .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ca n't wait to get rid of sprint because of this !","stars":1}
{"text":"if you go in make sure you do not get brian !","stars":1}
{"text":"i was very unimpressed with this store .","stars":1}
{"text":"he was very unhelpful and rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"i said i only use apple .","stars":1}
{"text":"the store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple .","stars":1}
{"text":"i got one $ _num_ credit but it did n't continue .","stars":1}
{"text":"that was _num_ weeks ago .","stars":1}
{"text":"a little more professionalism and significantly more customer appreciation is needed at this company .","stars":1}
{"text":"and the staff in the cafe is not the most friendly bunch .","stars":1}
{"text":"`` cafe '' could not be slower if they tried .","stars":1}
{"text":"very limited selection of everything .","stars":1}
{"text":"they need a serious remodeling and to clean this mess up .","stars":1}
{"text":"no refills on drinks were offered while we were there .","stars":1}
{"text":"the selection was similar to sweet tomatoes , but lower quality .","stars":1}
{"text":"stay as far away from this place as possible .","stars":1}
{"text":"big huge mistake .","stars":1}
{"text":"i am not sure what was worse ... the food or the employees .","stars":1}
{"text":"both looked grossed as hell .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place was filthy ... everywhere , and the food was nasty looking .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ca n't even imagine what the kitchen looks like .","stars":1}
{"text":"will never , ever visit this establishment again !","stars":1}
{"text":"the potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese .","stars":1}
{"text":"had n't been to this place in _num_ years .","stars":1}
{"text":"i have better tacos at home using fry 's brand of taco seasoning .","stars":1}
{"text":"the stations were messy and they were short staffed .","stars":1}
{"text":"the service was nice but not worth coming back .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was totally disappointed with this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"the waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was _num_ degrees today .","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's now to the point where it 's disgusting .","stars":1}
{"text":"we 'll not go back .","stars":1}
{"text":"the ice cream ( yogurt ) machine is no more .","stars":1}
{"text":"i wanted to like it , i really did .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was very disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"the rest of the food items were just gross .","stars":1}
{"text":"there is trash and food all over it .","stars":1}
{"text":"not a great selection , but cheaper than sweet tomato .","stars":1}
{"text":"still , gross !","stars":1}
{"text":"that should have been washed properly , someone could get sick .","stars":1}
{"text":"just went back this weekend .","stars":1}
{"text":"not as good as 1st few times .","stars":1}
{"text":"the place was crowded on monday morning ( labor day ) .","stars":1}
{"text":"when you 're passing through town , get thee to the grocery .","stars":1}
{"text":"my family of _num_ will not be returning .","stars":1}
{"text":"she was yelling so loud that the entire restaurant went quiet .","stars":1}
{"text":"which my mom was sitting at who uses a walker and has trouble moving .","stars":1}
{"text":"again in a super loud voice we were told no .","stars":1}
{"text":"myself and my family will not be returning to the place .","stars":1}
{"text":"surprisingly we did n't wait too long until our party of _num_ was seated .","stars":1}
{"text":"service was a bit slow and not that friendly .","stars":1}
{"text":"our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in california .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was a little disappointed with the quality and portion .","stars":1}
{"text":"another incident that should n't have happened was in the bakery .","stars":1}
{"text":"well , no kidding !","stars":1}
{"text":"the lady who takes your order is rude .","stars":1}
{"text":"the sides were terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"the mac n cheese was almost gone .","stars":1}
{"text":"no mashed potatoes .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was no chicken on the inside .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would have been better off at kfc .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is run down for a safeway .","stars":1}
{"text":"the deli and prepared food area smells bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"had the worst experience at the deli section .","stars":1}
{"text":"she started yelling and giving me bad attitude .","stars":1}
{"text":"i had to tell one of the managers but they did n't care .","stars":1}
{"text":"to add to that , they are super slow !","stars":1}
{"text":"i thought walmart cashiers were bad , these take the cake !","stars":1}
{"text":"had the worst experience with safeway this week .","stars":1}
{"text":"i got there and they only had one _num_ pack .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do n't know , though , just my opinion .","stars":1}
{"text":"so , his arrival did n't help the problem .","stars":1}
{"text":"and left , never to return .","stars":1}
{"text":"it did n't ring up so the cashier called someone .","stars":1}
{"text":"they do n't live up to their name .","stars":1}
{"text":"not smart and maybe not final .","stars":1}
{"text":"he did n't care that my daughter had gotten sick .","stars":1}
{"text":"his customers service skills are poor at best .","stars":1}
{"text":"afterwards , i went about my various errands for the day .","stars":1}
{"text":"it did n't take long to figure out what it was .","stars":1}
{"text":"according to aaa , the wrong size filter was installed .","stars":1}
{"text":"it just would n't be worthwhile .","stars":1}
{"text":"but now there 's no way i 'll ever go back .","stars":1}
{"text":"so i was immediately done with this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place has horrible customer service .","stars":1}
{"text":"terrible experience do n't recommend to anybody .","stars":1}
{"text":"otherwise it would get zero stars from me .","stars":1}
{"text":"the bad : where do i begin ?","stars":1}
{"text":"the place is worn and old looking inside and out .","stars":1}
{"text":"parking is horrible !","stars":1}
{"text":"trying to get in and out is a constant challenge .","stars":1}
{"text":"i could go on and on but i am sure you get the point .","stars":1}
{"text":"now this place is just a serious dive with little to no redeeming qualities .","stars":1}
{"text":"whose **** do i need to suck to get a drink around here ?","stars":1}
{"text":"the tired bartenders are over worked and under staffed .","stars":1}
{"text":"they lose a lot of points because of bad service .","stars":1}
{"text":"both times the bartender was too busy to take my dinner order .","stars":1}
{"text":"wo n't be this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"terrible service .","stars":1}
{"text":"only had one bartender and no server .","stars":1}
{"text":"they really need a waitress to run the floor .","stars":1}
{"text":"bomb wings but slow service .","stars":1}
{"text":"cheap drink specials .","stars":1}
{"text":"the staff is completely horrible and unprofessional .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was ate wings but i taste weird .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could give _num_ stars i would .","stars":1}
{"text":"will not be returning .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed - why ?","stars":1}
{"text":"not anymore .","stars":1}
{"text":"is n't that a little bit unethical ?","stars":1}
{"text":"buying here was the mistake of the year .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was like our couch was made from three leftover pieces they had .","stars":1}
{"text":"every time i drive by the store i 'm reminded of the horrible experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"it makes me never want to buy furniture again .","stars":1}
{"text":"the communication with this store was awful !","stars":1}
{"text":"getting by bed delivered was a pain .","stars":1}
{"text":"i had _num_ minutes to make it to the new location before they closed .","stars":1}
{"text":"no way i could make it across town on a friday night .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible customer service .","stars":1}
{"text":"mattress is _num_ months old .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible wont ever go back .","stars":1}
{"text":"i took my parents and unfortunately we were very disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"she was not a fan of the hummus she had or the greek salad .","stars":1}
{"text":"how can you mess up a greek salad ?","stars":1}
{"text":"serve it with a limp iceberg and a bland dressing , that 's how .","stars":1}
{"text":"i walked in and they told me they 're closed .","stars":1}
{"text":"the customer service was very lousy today .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would n't recommend this place to anyone .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was no sign or anything to say i could n't park there .","stars":1}
{"text":"i said , i 'm sorry , i did n't see any signs .","stars":1}
{"text":"what a horrible experience !","stars":1}
{"text":"however , just the other night , i found mold in my pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"customer service sucks .","stars":1}
{"text":"will not be eating little caesars ever again .","stars":1}
{"text":"service here sucked .","stars":1}
{"text":"i can excuse the mess because i know how inconsiderate customers can be .","stars":1}
{"text":"other than that i do n't know who else could appreciate this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"so in conclusion , this store ... do n't , just ... do n't .","stars":1}
{"text":"merchandise is really outdated .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is the inventory that no one wanted .","stars":1}
{"text":"no sales help , very depressing .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't plan on finding quality product at low prices .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would give this place zero stars if i could .","stars":1}
{"text":"employees were overly rude , inconsiderate and unprofessional .","stars":1}
{"text":"they tried telling us we drove _num_ miles !","stars":1}
{"text":"really disappointed with the service at this location .","stars":1}
{"text":"when i arrived to pick it up they did n't have it .","stars":1}
{"text":"they were rude and unapologetic .","stars":1}
{"text":"so basically their guarantee is that there is no guarantee .","stars":1}
{"text":"be polite on the phone , then hang up and talk crap about them .","stars":1}
{"text":"would n't recommend this dentist to anyone .","stars":1}
{"text":"the equipment they had was really outdated and painful .","stars":1}
{"text":"why schedule appointments if you ca n't be ready to serve your patients ?","stars":1}
{"text":"not like they 're doing the work for free !","stars":1}
{"text":"office max has officially lost my business .","stars":1}
{"text":"they do n't have my ink .","stars":1}
{"text":"they do n't carry my series number ( _num_ ) only up to _num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"we did n't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was a empty bar .","stars":1}
{"text":"walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only .","stars":1}
{"text":"so i was a little disappointed at this point .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was n't horrible tasting food , just bland for what i prefer .","stars":1}
{"text":"going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat i ordered the nachos .","stars":1}
{"text":"i pushed ignore .","stars":1}
{"text":"but there came a point that i could ignore no more .","stars":1}
{"text":"things were not right .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food is not cooked all the way , and , none wears gloves .","stars":1}
{"text":"i hate to give them just _num_ star .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"i seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight .","stars":1}
{"text":"they are rude and dirty .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is a warning : do n't go there !","stars":1}
{"text":"but i have to get this off my chest .","stars":1}
{"text":"sammy is my normal barber but he messed my hair up horribly yesterday .","stars":1}
{"text":"i gave him the same instructions on how to cut my hair like always .","stars":1}
{"text":"i will never be back to metro barber shop and not give anymore referrals .","stars":1}
{"text":"you really ca n't go wrong with fried shrimp .","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ star for that and another for the yummy biscuits .","stars":1}
{"text":"not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food .","stars":1}
{"text":"disappointing .","stars":1}
{"text":"bland .","stars":1}
{"text":"no flavor .","stars":1}
{"text":"and its not the first time that service was bad there .","stars":1}
{"text":"ok , all done with red lobster for a good long while now .","stars":1}
{"text":"host was friendly , waiter jeremy was super nice and manager was all smiles .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was pretty odd for an almost empty restaurant .","stars":1}
{"text":"i used to love the mussels appetizer , but this visit they were awful .","stars":1}
{"text":"the coconut shrimp was ok .","stars":1}
{"text":"i went to red lobster today with my family the service was horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"my appetizer was cold , half of the bowl of muscles were closed .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was our first time at red lobster , and probably our last .","stars":1}
{"text":"for app , we got the stuffed mushrooms with shrimp and lobster .","stars":1}
{"text":"but , the shrimp linguini totally blew .","stars":1}
{"text":"absolutely terrible service from our waitress .","stars":1}
{"text":"waited _num_ minutes just for bread .","stars":1}
{"text":"will not be coming back .","stars":1}
{"text":"the hostess was very unfriendly .","stars":1}
{"text":"they would n't remove it from our bill nor offer any discounts .","stars":1}
{"text":"extremely disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place sucks !","stars":1}
{"text":"i really expected so much more but was completely disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"with the first bite i knew it was not what i expected .","stars":1}
{"text":"the meat was like a lunch meat instead of real sliced deli beef .","stars":1}
{"text":"could hardly find the mozzarella either .","stars":1}

{"text":"i do n't know what happened but the crust is not the same .","stars":1}
{"text":"too bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"the cheese is different , the crust is different .","stars":1}
{"text":"why why why ?","stars":1}
{"text":"the wings are sorry .","stars":1}
{"text":"if this is a recipe change it is not a good one .","stars":1}
{"text":"the manager , steve , was very rude .","stars":1}

{"text":"when we received our order of wings , they were cold .","stars":1}
{"text":"he was a total ass .","stars":1}
{"text":"and the cashier was a complete bitch .","stars":1}
{"text":"her attitude was disgusting .","stars":1}
{"text":"so my wings came out _num_ mins before pizza was done .","stars":1}
{"text":"making my wings get cold as i waited for the pizza to get done .","stars":1}
{"text":"lots of issues with the games not working and not giving tickets out .","stars":1}
{"text":"my food experience was just so strange and terrible at the same time .","stars":1}
{"text":"the salad was heavy on the onions , easy on the anything else .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do n't understand why they do n't do dressing either .","stars":1}
{"text":"so the salad was a fail .","stars":1}
{"text":"for the soup , i went with the chicken & gnocchi .","stars":1}
{"text":"it did n't taste horrible , just cheap ... so only a minor fail .","stars":1}
{"text":"food arrives , everything is normal , whatever .","stars":1}
{"text":"( to eat , not to love , but to eat ) .","stars":1}
{"text":"i strongly suggest something ( anything ) else .","stars":1}
{"text":"may i recommend the apricot chicken or mixed grill ?","stars":1}
{"text":"there where _num_ waiters , still service was slow .","stars":1}
{"text":"both waiters where rude and condescending .","stars":1}

{"text":"she said , sorry you 're next .","stars":1}
{"text":"night was ruined before i got my food .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would normally give og a 3-4 .","stars":1}

{"text":"so i asked again for the manager and explained the situation .","stars":1}
{"text":"i used to love olive garden but its become so blah .","stars":1}
{"text":"so we sat there for _num_ minutes before she even sat us .","stars":1}
{"text":"not thrilled with this place , probably wo n't come here again .","stars":1}
{"text":"she was not even friendly !","stars":1}
{"text":"heavy sauces , bland dishes and so-so service .","stars":1}
{"text":"also , someone said the regulars are a joy to hang out with ?","stars":1}
{"text":"maybe i am just visiting at the wrong time .","stars":1}
{"text":"so i do not recommend this location plus , they hardly have anything .","stars":1}
{"text":"the selection was better but probably because it 's a ghost town at metro .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't go to this metro location .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place was filthy !","stars":1}
{"text":"we found _num_ in a corner , the rest was n't cleaned .","stars":1}
{"text":"several trays were empty , and were not refilled .","stars":1}
{"text":")","stars":1}
{"text":"no words for this experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"never again in this dump .","stars":1}
{"text":"so disappointing .","stars":1}

{"text":"there are three left and i believe this is the worst of them .","stars":1}
{"text":"we gave up on getting him off our backs and walked out without ordering .","stars":1}
{"text":"worst experience ever !","stars":1}
{"text":"waiter dropped off food and never came back !","stars":1}
{"text":"did n't care if we needed anything .","stars":1}
{"text":"the chicken alfredo was nasty .","stars":1}
{"text":"sauce tastes old and left over .","stars":1}
{"text":"$ _num_ for two _num_ oz steaks _num_ salad bar .","stars":1}
{"text":"absolute no seasoning on the nasty meat .","stars":1}
{"text":"crappy buffet .","stars":1}
{"text":"at the very best it should have been under $ _num_ for it all .","stars":1}
{"text":"luckily no one here cares that they serve you horrible food .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food was awful .","stars":1}
{"text":"the steak had absolutely no taste .","stars":1}
{"text":"there is a texas roadhouse around the corner .","stars":1}
{"text":"unfortunately we will never make the mistakes of going to this location again !","stars":1}
{"text":"food was warm that was suppose to be cold and chicken wings were old .","stars":1}
{"text":"overall a bad experience for _num_ bucks !","stars":1}
{"text":"big mistake .","stars":1}
{"text":"nothing was working .","stars":1}
{"text":"her potato was burnt and dry .","stars":1}
{"text":"her entire meal was horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"unhappy and unsatisfied .","stars":1}
{"text":"awful , food sits and is old .","stars":1}
{"text":"i asked for a to go box for a left over roll and shrimp .","stars":1}
{"text":"the waiter said i could n't take the shrimp home because it was unlimited .","stars":1}
{"text":"to the lazy manager you lost a loyal customer over shrimp !","stars":1}
{"text":"so for _num_ , i would skip this place !","stars":1}
{"text":"i was so very disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"i could n't even bring myself to finish one bowl .","stars":1}
{"text":"to make matters worse , the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse .","stars":1}
{"text":"hardly any sauces , and it 's totally ugly inside .","stars":1}
{"text":"their pineapple was bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"avoid this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has .","stars":1}
{"text":"i opted for the cod .","stars":1}
{"text":"not a fan .","stars":1}
{"text":"but i am not sure about the frozen lunch meat you are offered .","stars":1}
{"text":"it seemed gross and chewy .","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"_num_ .","stars":1}
{"text":"upon entering , the atmosphere was just ok .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was nothing special .","stars":1}
{"text":"it simply did n't `` hit the spot '' so to speak .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was a _num_ dollar bowl for crying out loud .","stars":1}
{"text":"i declined the box and left my leftovers at the restaurant .","stars":1}
{"text":"honestly this is one of the worst food dining experiences i have ever had .","stars":1}
{"text":"all i ate there was crunchy rice and soy sauce .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would not recommend this place to anyone ever .","stars":1}
{"text":"there 's no chance i will ever be back .","stars":1}
{"text":"guess it 's not my thing .","stars":1}
{"text":"even the ice cream for dessert lacks luster .","stars":1}
{"text":"no toppings , just soft serve vanilla ice cream .","stars":1}
{"text":"to be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks .","stars":1}
{"text":"maybe mongolian grills are not my thing .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was no one else in there .","stars":1}
{"text":"lame .","stars":1}
{"text":"went tonight on a recognition and was horribly disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"this does n't even come close .","stars":1}
{"text":"the meats looked like frozen , rolled up lunch meat .","stars":1}
{"text":"my man did n't even finish his good and that never happens .","stars":1}
{"text":"even the frozen yogurt did n't taste very good .","stars":1}
{"text":"wow this place is bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"the cashier asked who is going to eat because there is not sharing ?","stars":1}
{"text":"also they do not have gluten free soy sauce .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would stay away from this restaurant .","stars":1}
{"text":"not worth the money .","stars":1}

{"text":"$ _num_ plus tax for two people , one bowl each !","stars":1}

{"text":"i hate it .","stars":1}
{"text":"i have never not had to wait in a 10+ minute wait line .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is the absolute worst walgreens i 've ever been to .","stars":1}
{"text":"they do n't have a separate person working the drive through window .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't come here without expecting do wait over _num_ mins .","stars":1}

{"text":"chuck e cheese is our typical friday outing .","stars":1}
{"text":"so we she did get to see him but almost by force .","stars":1}
{"text":"no eggs no green olives ect and paid almost ten dollars !","stars":1}

{"text":"there was comes a time when you make bad choices .","stars":1}
{"text":"so gross today .","stars":1}

{"text":"i do n't know how else to put it .","stars":1}
{"text":"so of course i am going to use the vet visit .","stars":1}

{"text":"i called the salon before purchasing the groupon to check their availability .","stars":1}
{"text":"the customer service that i experienced here was on par with any other salon .","stars":1}
{"text":"however , this is a school .","stars":1}
{"text":"as such , the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable .","stars":1}
{"text":"it is simply awful .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was very disappointed with my manicure .","stars":1}
{"text":"my pedicure , however , turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would not recommend this salon , nor will i be returning .","stars":1}
{"text":"when entering , i was willing to give the techs a chance .","stars":1}
{"text":"usually , i could use my groupon right away but whatever '' .","stars":1}

{"text":"of course , i called management and they said they would security immediately .","stars":1}
{"text":"no child or baby here .","stars":1}
