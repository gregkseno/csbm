{"text":"ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .","stars":1}
{"text":"there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .","stars":1}
{"text":"so basically tasted watered down .","stars":1}
{"text":"she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .","stars":1}
{"text":"just left and took it off the bill .","stars":1}
{"text":"it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .","stars":1}
{"text":"definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !","stars":1}
{"text":"new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .","stars":1}
{"text":"but it probably sucks too !","stars":1}
{"text":"we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .","stars":1}
{"text":"the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .","stars":1}
{"text":"said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .","stars":1}
{"text":"the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .","stars":1}
{"text":"there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland .","stars":1}
{"text":"the wine was very average and the food was even less .","stars":1}
{"text":"staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .","stars":1}
{"text":"the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .","stars":1}
{"text":"blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .","stars":1}
{"text":"my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .","stars":1}
{"text":"she said `` yes , sorry . ''","stars":1}
{"text":"the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was only meat and bread .","stars":1}
{"text":"when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door .","stars":1}
{"text":"she was not happy being there .","stars":1}
{"text":"moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless .","stars":1}
{"text":"the associates program is no longer an option .","stars":1}
{"text":"the decor was seriously lacking .","stars":1}
{"text":"anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location .","stars":1}
{"text":"the sales people here are terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"salsa is not hot or good .","stars":1}
{"text":"so i asked for the card to be refunded .","stars":1}
{"text":"i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .","stars":1}
{"text":"all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .","stars":1}
{"text":"the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .","stars":1}
{"text":"they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .","stars":1}
{"text":"we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .","stars":1}
{"text":"always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !","stars":1}
{"text":"they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .","stars":1}
{"text":"i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .","stars":1}
{"text":"my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .","stars":1}
{"text":"when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .","stars":1}
{"text":"you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .","stars":1}
{"text":"i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was very sick the night after .","stars":1}
{"text":"i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again .","stars":1}
{"text":"i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !","stars":1}
{"text":"had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered .","stars":1}
{"text":"this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .","stars":1}
{"text":"then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not go to this practice they are horrible !","stars":1}
{"text":"i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .","stars":1}
{"text":"the only saving grace was the black beans .","stars":1}
{"text":"lost a long time customer !","stars":1}
{"text":"other than that , food here is pretty gross .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .","stars":1}
{"text":"so far i 'm not really impressed .","stars":1}
{"text":"my groupon is only for the two windows .","stars":1}
{"text":"safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .","stars":1}
{"text":"we will not be using this location again .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is a horrible venue .","stars":1}
{"text":"you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .","stars":1}
{"text":"but it may not actually be in stock anyway .","stars":1}
{"text":"owner : a very rude man .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is a terrible place to live !","stars":1}
{"text":"stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .","stars":1}
{"text":"my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .","stars":1}
{"text":"it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .","stars":1}
{"text":"what about the time i wasted ?","stars":1}
{"text":"there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !","stars":1}
{"text":"the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .","stars":1}
{"text":"executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .","stars":1}
{"text":"this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .","stars":1}
{"text":"not even real brown sauce .","stars":1}
{"text":"i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .","stars":1}
{"text":"but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .","stars":1}
{"text":"his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .","stars":1}
{"text":"the salads are ok , nothing special .","stars":1}
{"text":"overall it was a miserable evening .","stars":1}
{"text":"the woman did n't even apologize .","stars":1}
{"text":"i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was .","stars":1}
{"text":"zero complaints with his work .","stars":1}
{"text":"the garlic bread was bland and cold .","stars":1}
{"text":"the espresso was way too hot .","stars":1}
{"text":"i know i should have sent this back and walk out .","stars":1}
{"text":"they wo n't tell you though .","stars":1}
{"text":"i love the food ... however service here is horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"gammage itself however is not so amazing .","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .","stars":1}
{"text":"i wo n't be ordering again .","stars":1}
{"text":"let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .","stars":1}
{"text":"she did not apologize or anything .","stars":1}
{"text":"prices are just plain retail .","stars":1}
{"text":"but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .","stars":1}
{"text":"it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .","stars":1}
{"text":"who knows , it might have been .","stars":1}
{"text":"the beer sauce is lackluster at best .","stars":1}
{"text":"the building itself looks abandoned .","stars":1}
{"text":"we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 've never had a worse experience than this !","stars":1}
{"text":"no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could give zero stars i def would .","stars":1}
{"text":"only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .","stars":1}
{"text":"no call , no nothing .","stars":1}
{"text":"i wish i could give less than one star .","stars":1}
{"text":"the wonton was seriously lacking filling .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i could give less stars , i would .","stars":1}
{"text":"she could not and would not explain herself .","stars":1}
{"text":"think twice -- this place is a dump .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm not one of the corn people .","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .","stars":1}
{"text":"even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down .","stars":1}
{"text":"as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years .","stars":1}
{"text":"i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color .","stars":1}
{"text":"so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .","stars":1}
{"text":"at this location the service was terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"so who do i call to get my money back .","stars":1}
{"text":"overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .","stars":1}
{"text":"service was a little slow to begin with .","stars":1}
{"text":"only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .","stars":1}
{"text":"i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .","stars":1}
{"text":"just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .","stars":1}
{"text":"i expected so much better from this ny staple .","stars":1}
{"text":"i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .","stars":1}
{"text":"they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .","stars":1}
{"text":"the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .","stars":1}
{"text":"i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .","stars":1}
{"text":"and the cleaning is way over priced .","stars":1}
{"text":"they make a bad name for used car dealers .","stars":1}
{"text":"when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .","stars":1}
{"text":"so sad but i am not going back any more .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .","stars":1}
{"text":"the new management team is horrible !","stars":1}
{"text":"just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .","stars":1}
{"text":"they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .","stars":1}
{"text":"the evening started out slow .","stars":1}
{"text":"i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool .","stars":1}
{"text":"the queen bed was horrible !","stars":1}
{"text":"meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .","stars":1}
{"text":"oh , i should not have asked .","stars":1}
{"text":"my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is just ok .","stars":1}
{"text":"i have to say i was truly disappointed .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is the reason i will never go back .","stars":1}
{"text":"furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu .","stars":1}
{"text":"when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !","stars":1}
{"text":"the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"nope , way way worse .","stars":1}
{"text":"there are no smiles and no customer service .","stars":1}
{"text":"when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .","stars":1}
{"text":"the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .","stars":1}
{"text":"if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck .","stars":1}
{"text":"plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .","stars":1}
{"text":"overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?","stars":1}
{"text":"the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well .","stars":1}
{"text":"food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs .","stars":1}
{"text":"was n't busy , no biggie .","stars":1}
{"text":"the bathroom area is nothing special .","stars":1}
{"text":"this room that he found also reeked of smoke !","stars":1}
{"text":"also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .","stars":1}
{"text":"so i brought my business elsewhere .","stars":1}
{"text":"exhibit c : no more student services peeps .","stars":1}
{"text":"so disappointing from an old favorite .","stars":1}
{"text":"it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .","stars":1}
{"text":"tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .","stars":1}
{"text":"the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .","stars":1}
{"text":"i will never visit the salon again .","stars":1}
{"text":"they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would n't go back there again .","stars":1}
{"text":"this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .","stars":1}
{"text":"the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"as for the food , never had it .","stars":1}
{"text":"however , the tech said nothing to me about this .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .","stars":1}
{"text":"my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .","stars":1}
{"text":"it does not take that long to cook sliders !","stars":1}
{"text":"the sandwich was not that great .","stars":1}
{"text":"the man did not stop her .","stars":1}
{"text":"um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .","stars":1}
{"text":"tasted really old , i could n't believe it .","stars":1}
{"text":"it is also quite expensive for my taste .","stars":1}
{"text":"food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .","stars":1}
{"text":"lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .","stars":1}
{"text":"it shows that this restaurant has no class .","stars":1}
{"text":"one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .","stars":1}
{"text":"we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .","stars":1}
{"text":"my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .","stars":1}
{"text":"when i arrived , no one was at the desk .","stars":1}
{"text":"we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .","stars":1}
{"text":"even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .","stars":1}
{"text":"wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .","stars":1}
{"text":"as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .","stars":1}
{"text":"the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .","stars":1}
{"text":"but i darn sure could have cooked this one .","stars":1}
{"text":"just terrible is all i can say .","stars":1}
{"text":"did they not have a fountain machine on site ?","stars":1}
{"text":"his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .","stars":1}
{"text":"stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .","stars":1}
{"text":"we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .","stars":1}
{"text":"always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .","stars":1}
{"text":"however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .","stars":1}
{"text":"so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .","stars":1}
{"text":"overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .","stars":1}
{"text":"one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .","stars":1}
{"text":"there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .","stars":1}
{"text":"is zero stars an option ?","stars":1}
{"text":"in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .","stars":1}
{"text":"but let this story begin at noon today .","stars":1}
{"text":"seriously though , i have never shopped here .","stars":1}
{"text":"it is the absolute worse place in the valley .","stars":1}
{"text":"but their inventory was questionable !","stars":1}
{"text":"chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .","stars":1}
{"text":"so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .","stars":1}
{"text":"were we irritating her or something ?","stars":1}
{"text":"this place has pissed me off for the last time .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not sign a lease with these people .","stars":1}
{"text":"do n't waste the trip .","stars":1}
{"text":"had to returned one entree because too cold .","stars":1}
{"text":"the restroom was a mess .","stars":1}
{"text":"i mean that 's been my experience !","stars":1}
{"text":"the beef taco was good but nothing special .","stars":1}
{"text":"either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .","stars":1}
{"text":"i went to sit down and wait for my order .","stars":1}
{"text":"its also not a very clean park .","stars":1}
{"text":"i tried to call repeatedly with no response .","stars":1}
{"text":"they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .","stars":1}
{"text":"it looks old and outdated .","stars":1}
{"text":"he did not return my call either .","stars":1}
{"text":"if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food here is bland and boring and bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"this one is not on the ball .","stars":1}
{"text":"for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !","stars":1}
{"text":"the tow package is not an issue either .","stars":1}
{"text":"very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .","stars":1}
{"text":"i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'll keep looking for a different salon .","stars":1}
{"text":"you can not pay me to ever shop here !","stars":1}
{"text":"french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .","stars":1}
{"text":"now the food : not horrible , but below average .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .","stars":1}
{"text":"no stars is what in want to give .","stars":1}
{"text":"when it came we should have sent it back .","stars":1}
{"text":"the equipment is so old and looks dirty .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm not willing to take the chance .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place smelt like old urine for some reason .","stars":1}
{"text":"bottom line they over promise and under deliver .","stars":1}
{"text":"i dont know why i was expecting anything different .","stars":1}
{"text":"nothing that special about this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"razz 's failed on every occasion .","stars":1}
{"text":"management no longer cares about the golf experience .","stars":1}
{"text":"20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .","stars":1}
{"text":"the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .","stars":1}
{"text":"found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .","stars":1}
{"text":"not sure and i do n't care !","stars":1}
{"text":"two hours of my life i can never get back .","stars":1}
{"text":"dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .","stars":1}
{"text":"very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .","stars":1}
{"text":"second time , not so good .","stars":1}
{"text":"the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .","stars":1}
{"text":"he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .","stars":1}
{"text":"what the hell are you doing ?","stars":1}
{"text":"the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"the dipping sauce was too sweet too .","stars":1}
{"text":"finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .","stars":1}
{"text":"i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .","stars":1}
{"text":"liar , liar , pants on fire .","stars":1}
{"text":"parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .","stars":1}
{"text":"i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .","stars":1}
{"text":"not so great food and service .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is an old worn out hotel .","stars":1}
{"text":"the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .","stars":1}
{"text":"the mechanics are very amateur as usual .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is beyond a shit hole .","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is a shit hole with shit service .","stars":1}
{"text":"however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .","stars":1}
{"text":"went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .","stars":1}
{"text":"service was just as disappointing .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .","stars":1}
{"text":"the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .","stars":1}
{"text":"management does not seem to care .","stars":1}
{"text":"i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .","stars":1}
{"text":"it is not really brown rice .","stars":1}
{"text":"did n't even get a response .","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving .","stars":1}
{"text":"my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .","stars":1}
{"text":"i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .","stars":1}
{"text":"had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .","stars":1}
{"text":"she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .","stars":1}
{"text":"i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .","stars":1}
{"text":"i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .","stars":1}
{"text":"it did n't get finished .","stars":1}
{"text":"we will not be coming back .","stars":1}
{"text":"he could n't actually read her pressure , though .","stars":1}
{"text":"absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much .","stars":1}
{"text":"even the water tasted horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .","stars":1}
{"text":"sounds good does n't it ?","stars":1}
{"text":"but it was disgusting and hot in there .","stars":1}
{"text":"yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was over fried and very hard .","stars":1}
{"text":"i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .","stars":1}
{"text":"the overall prices are not competitive with frys .","stars":1}
{"text":"too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .","stars":1}
{"text":"we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .","stars":1}
{"text":"and management does n't do anything about it .","stars":1}
{"text":"no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .","stars":1}
{"text":"what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !","stars":1}
{"text":"these days the quality is pretty lousy .","stars":1}
{"text":"this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .","stars":1}
{"text":"service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .","stars":1}
{"text":"my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .","stars":1}
{"text":"and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .","stars":1}
{"text":"maybe they were having a bad night ?","stars":1}
{"text":"this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !","stars":1}
{"text":"the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .","stars":1}
{"text":"so , it went in the trash .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .","stars":1}
{"text":"so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .","stars":1}
{"text":"hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .","stars":1}
{"text":"the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .","stars":1}
{"text":"when it finally came out , it was bad .","stars":1}
{"text":"talk about false advertising so call before you go !","stars":1}
{"text":"the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .","stars":1}
{"text":"but the customer service ruins it all for me .","stars":1}
{"text":"i just walked out , called the manager to complain .","stars":1}
{"text":"i was very disappointed with this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"so you are n't my problem . ''","stars":1}
{"text":"unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .","stars":1}
{"text":"geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .","stars":1}
{"text":"she does n't say anything and just walks away .","stars":1}
{"text":"the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .","stars":1}
{"text":"the staff was nowhere to be found .","stars":1}
{"text":"it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .","stars":1}
{"text":"it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .","stars":1}
{"text":"i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .","stars":1}
{"text":"save your money & your patience .","stars":1}
{"text":"what a waste of my time and theirs .","stars":1}
{"text":"one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .","stars":1}
{"text":"my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .","stars":1}
{"text":"the server was n't buying .","stars":1}
{"text":"worst customer service i have ever had .","stars":1}
{"text":"sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .","stars":1}
{"text":"and for this reason , i wo n't return .","stars":1}
{"text":"this branch is getting worse and worse .","stars":1}
{"text":"they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .","stars":1}
{"text":"they can thank you for the low rating .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't even eat it .","stars":1}
{"text":"this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .","stars":1}
{"text":"there was no personality to our server .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .","stars":1}
{"text":"i did n't know ra was a chain .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .","stars":1}
{"text":"went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .","stars":1}
{"text":"the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .","stars":1}
{"text":"i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .","stars":1}
{"text":"however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .","stars":1}
{"text":"is that a good thing or a bad thing ?","stars":1}
{"text":"maria the manager is a horrible person .","stars":1}
{"text":"it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .","stars":1}
{"text":"we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .","stars":1}
{"text":"first , the bartender was an a -- hole .","stars":1}
{"text":"absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .","stars":1}
{"text":"i guess even great restaurants have bad days .","stars":1}
{"text":"oh well , who cares ... right ?","stars":1}
{"text":"we will spend our money elsewhere .","stars":1}
{"text":"i will never purchase another lv bag again .","stars":1}
{"text":"uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .","stars":1}
{"text":"we did n't leave with anything that day .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible , horrible , horrible service !","stars":1}
{"text":"now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .","stars":1}
{"text":"this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .","stars":1}
{"text":"i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .","stars":1}
{"text":"the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .","stars":1}
{"text":"you can not judge people based on appearance .","stars":1}
{"text":"you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .","stars":1}
{"text":"the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .","stars":1}
{"text":"no courtesy and their food is pathetic .","stars":1}
{"text":"i would never reccomend anyone to live here .","stars":1}
{"text":"had to wait a month to get in .","stars":1}
{"text":"great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !","stars":1}
{"text":"it was my last weekend visiting my folks .","stars":1}
{"text":"next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .","stars":1}
{"text":"do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .","stars":1}
{"text":"prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .","stars":1}
{"text":"tonight i lost all respect for this company .","stars":1}
{"text":"safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .","stars":1}
{"text":"i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .","stars":1}
{"text":"let me tell you , this place was far from busy !","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .","stars":1}
{"text":"the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .","stars":1}
{"text":"included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .","stars":1}
{"text":"the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !","stars":1}
{"text":"other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food is not that authentic .","stars":1}
{"text":"actually , just keep walking .","stars":1}
{"text":"unfortunately , it is the worst .","stars":1}
{"text":"the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .","stars":1}
{"text":"not so much these days .","stars":1}
{"text":"did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is the worst panda express location there is !","stars":1}
{"text":"the door would n't open at all .","stars":1}
{"text":"my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .","stars":1}
{"text":"the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .","stars":1}
{"text":"we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .","stars":1}
{"text":"i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .","stars":1}
{"text":"it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !","stars":1}
{"text":"this is a terrible college .","stars":1}
{"text":"my jack and coke was seriously lacking .","stars":1}
{"text":"sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .","stars":1}
{"text":"the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .","stars":1}
{"text":"i looked around and there were still customers .","stars":1}
{"text":"i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .","stars":1}
{"text":"we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .","stars":1}
{"text":"in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .","stars":1}
{"text":"avoid if at all possible .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .","stars":1}
{"text":"we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's just too expensive for what you get .","stars":1}
{"text":"also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?","stars":1}
{"text":"went into this location to drop it off .","stars":1}
{"text":"we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .","stars":1}
{"text":"too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .","stars":1}
{"text":"the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .","stars":1}
{"text":"the beer was nice and cold !","stars":1}
{"text":"the woman who works in the deli is horrible .","stars":1}
{"text":"will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !","stars":1}
{"text":"there are much better places for breakfast .","stars":1}
{"text":"the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .","stars":1}
{"text":"it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .","stars":1}
{"text":"um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .","stars":1}
{"text":"pathetic place , worst food .","stars":1}
{"text":"needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .","stars":1}
{"text":"firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .","stars":1}
{"text":"anything they say , ask in writing .","stars":1}
{"text":"this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .","stars":1}
{"text":"but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .","stars":1}
{"text":"built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .","stars":1}
{"text":"bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .","stars":1}
{"text":"if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !","stars":1}
{"text":"she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .","stars":1}
{"text":"incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .","stars":1}
{"text":"the green enchiladas were ok but not great .","stars":1}
{"text":"the problem is nothing was good .","stars":1}
{"text":"i tried to no avail .","stars":1}
{"text":"university is also almost as bad as living on apache .","stars":1}
{"text":"horrible job on nails and toes .","stars":1}
{"text":"i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .","stars":1}
{"text":"perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .","stars":1}
{"text":"simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .","stars":1}
{"text":"took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .","stars":1}
{"text":"sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !","stars":1}
{"text":"that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .","stars":1}
{"text":"the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .","stars":1}
{"text":"they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .","stars":1}
{"text":"desert followed but nothing special .","stars":1}
{"text":"no massage with my manicure or pedicure .","stars":1}
{"text":"i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .","stars":1}
{"text":"however , this experience went pretty smooth .","stars":1}
{"text":"they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .","stars":1}
{"text":"since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !","stars":1}
{"text":"she was getting pissed , and so were we .","stars":1}
{"text":"did n't seem to care about their job .","stars":1}
{"text":"would have rated lower if i could .","stars":1}
{"text":"not personalized or warm at all .","stars":1}
{"text":"so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .","stars":1}
{"text":"i do not like the size of the dance floor .","stars":1}
{"text":"this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .","stars":1}
{"text":"i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .","stars":1}
{"text":"their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .","stars":1}
{"text":"no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .","stars":1}
{"text":"three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .","stars":1}
{"text":"ra sushi , you are so blah to me .","stars":1}
{"text":"half of my head was over processed .","stars":1}
{"text":"an old dude did my pedicure .","stars":1}
{"text":"like it 's been in a fridge for a week .","stars":1}
{"text":"`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .","stars":1}
{"text":"when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .","stars":1}
